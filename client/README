This directory contains the files for the cloud scheduler job
submission client.  This job submission client is simply a wrapper
around the condor_submit command.  The job submission client will
first put the user's proxy to a myproxy server (by making a call to
myproxy-init) and update the job description file with information
about the remotely stored user credentials.  The client will then call
the condor_submit command for the user.

TODO: Add some more documentation on the usage of the client wrapper
once it is more finalized.

IMPORTANT: Note that this component is still in developement and
should not be used for production use.
