# This configuration file contains clusters that make up a cloud.

#
# Explanation:
#  name 	- a colloqial name for the cluster
#  network_IP	- a publicly accesible IP address for the cluster headnode
#  vm_slots	- the max. number of VMs that can be run on the cluster at any one time
#  cpu_cores	- the number of CPU cores per machine on the cluster worker nodes*
#  storageGB	- the amount of storage (in GB) available on the cluster worker nodes*
#  memoryMB	- the amount of memory (in MB) available on the cluster worker nodes*
#  x86		- a flag for whether or not the cluster has x86 processors (yes/no)
#  x86_64	- a flag for whether or not the cluster has x86_64 processors (yes/no)
#  network_pub	- a flag for whether or not the cluster has public IP address space for VMs (yes/no)
#  network_priv	- a flag for whether or not the cluster has private IP address space for VMs (yes/no)
#
# *: These fields represent the specs of cluster worker nodes. If the cluster has heterogeneous worker 
#    nodes, use the lowest values possible (from any worker node) to give performance guarantees.
#

# Example:
# gridcn/142.104.111.222/10/4/100/1024/yes/no/yes/yes
#

# clusterX (at 111.222.333.444) has 5 VM slots, and has worker nodes with quadcore CPUs, with at least 50
# GBs of storage and 1024 MBs of RAM. clusterX has x86, but not x86_64 processors, and has private IP space
# avaible for VM use.
