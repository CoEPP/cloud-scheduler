Test Sets README

This README describes the contents of the test-sets directory, which contains
sample job sets and scripts for testing the cloud scheduler.

The directory is organized into subdirectories that hold the jobs and scripts
particular to specific cloud scheduler releases. An example is the directory
cs0.2, which holds the jobs and scripts set to acceptance test the Cloud
Scheduler version 0.2.

Test job files are .sub files.

Test scripts execute various tasks to submit jobs and measure cloud scheduler
functionality. The scripts are briefly described below.


GENERAL SCRIPTS (located in the scripts/ directory):

submit-multiples
    This script simply submits multiple jobs to the condor job pool. The script
    will number output files to match the submission sequence.
    For usage, run the ./submit-multiples
job-distribution
    This script gets the distribution of jobs to the hostnames of the VM machines
    where the jobs ran. Run it on the output files of a fully completed job set.
    ./job-distribution *.out

CLOUD SCHEDULER 0.2:

test-cloudscheduler
    This script is a simple walk-through script that executes a 100 job test
    against a running cloud scheduler. It submits 25 instances of 4 different
    jobs (jobs with differing requirements).
    Run ./test-cloudscheduler for information.
